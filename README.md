# Mixed-Python-Tools
> This repository is a collection of scripts I created out of boredom, currently sitting unused on my computer.

| Tool Name | Description | Requirements (pip install) |
|--|--|-- |
|`openai_key_validator.py`|This Python script is a tool that verifies the user's OpenAI API key. It takes the API key from the user, sends a test request to the gpt-4o model of OpenAI, and checks the validity of the key. If successful, a green confirmation message will show a red error message if it fails.|`openai colorama rich`|
|`directory_tree_generator.py`|This Python application allows users to generate a visual directory tree of a selected folder. It offers options like excluding specific files or folders, filtering by file extensions, and displaying metadata such as size and last modified date. The output can be viewed directly in the app, exported as a text file, or saved as a styled HTML report.|`customtkinter`|
|`url_checker.py`|This Python application scrapes all the links from a given website and checks their HTTP status codes. It uses Selenium to collect URLs and Requests to verify them. Results are displayed in a GUI built with CustomTkinter, with options to search, filter, and export the results as a JSON file.|`customtkinter selenium requests`|
|`system_memory_info.py`|This Python script provides information about your system's VRAM (GPU memory) and total system RAM. It checks for an available NVIDIA GPU using the pynvml library and retrieves VRAM details such as total, used, and free memory. It also displays the total system RAM using psutil. If no NVIDIA GPU is found or the pynvml library is not installed, it suggests alternative tools.|`psutil pynvml`|
|`openai_finetune.py`|This Python script allows you to upload a dataset file to OpenAI, initiate a fine-tuning process, and monitor its status. It interacts with the OpenAI API to upload files, start fine-tuning with a specified model, and track the fine-tuning process. The user is prompted to input their OpenAI API key and dataset file path. It supports error handling and provides feedback on success or failure during the process.|`requests`|
|`exif_sniffer.py`|This Python script is a command-line tool designed to display the EXIF metadata of image files in the current directory. It provides an interactive interface for users to select an image file and view its detailed metadata in a formatted table.|`rich colorama exif pillow`|
|`logger.py`|This Python script processes log files, extracts relevant data (such as IP address, request method, and timestamp), and provides features like searching and saving filtered results. It leverages the re module for parsing, os for file operations, datetime for handling timestamps, and colorama for colorful terminal output. Additionally, the script tracks how many times each IP address has accessed the logs and allows the user to search for specific terms within the log file.|`colorama`|
|`textsentinel.py`|Python tool designed to detect and highlight duplicate sentences in text files. Users can easily select a file directly from the current directory or via a file dialog. The tool then scans the file to identify sentences that appear more than once, presenting the results in a structured, colorful table using the rich library.|`rich colorama`|
|`turkish_json_fixer.py`|This Python script automatically fixes issues with Turkish characters in JSON files that are incorrectly encoded in UTF-8. It specifically targets situations where Turkish characters are represented as Unicode escape sequences (e.g., "\uXXXX") and converts them back to their original form.|`No additional libraries`|
|`worldgraph.py`|This Python script is a tool that allows users to create artistic maps based on any city or region in the world. It provides an interactive menu where users can select the network type, background color, image resolution, and output directory. The script downloads map data, styles the roads based on their lengths, and generates a high-quality image. Progress is shown with colorful terminal animations, and the final map is saved automatically.|`osmnx rich matplotlib`|
|`secure_folder_remover.py`|This Python script allows users to delete any folder on their system through a graphical folder picker. It requires administrator privileges to run. The user selects a folder via a File Explorer window, and if selected, the script attempts to delete it, handling permission errors gracefully.|`tk`|
